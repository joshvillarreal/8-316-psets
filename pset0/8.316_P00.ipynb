    "<h3>Indexing and Slicing</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "The shape of the resulting array is different depending on if you use indexing or slicing.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Indexing</b> refers to selecting one particular element of an array by using single numbers (the indices) to specify the corresponding row and column.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that Python uses **zero-indexing**, which means that the first rows and first column are denoted 0, not 1. This is different from R and MATLAB. Because of this counting convention, indexing the 3rd row and 4th column of a matrix `B` would be written `B[2,3]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Negative numbers are used as indices which count from the end of a row or column. However, because of the difficulty in software of distinguishing `+0` and `-0`, there is no negative equivalent of zero-indexing, so `-1` indicates the last row or column. For example, `B[-1,-1]` indicates the bottom right element (last row and column) in a matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Slicing</b> refers to selecting a subset of the array by specifying a range of indices. The notation used for ranges is  `n:m`, where `n` is the index of the initial row or column (with the counting again starting at zero). Contrary to what you might expect, `m` is **not** the index of the final row or column. Instead, that index is `m-1`. So, selecting the 3rd through 4th row and 5th through 7th column of an array would be denoted `A[2:4,4:7]`. Leaving the end of the range blank, for example `1:`, denotes that the range ends at the last row or column in the matrix. Similarly, you can leave the first index blank to indicate a range that starts at the first row or column. This latter option is not really needed since one can start the indicated range with `0:` for any matrix. The output of slicing is another matrix but with a different number of rows and/or columns than the original.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that you can combine indexing and slicing by selecting a single index for either the row or column and a range for the other one. In this case, the output is a 1D vector, either a single row or a single column.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're unfamiliar with these terms, you can also look at the official numpy documentation <a href=\"https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/arrays.indexing.html\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.\n",
